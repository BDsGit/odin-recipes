        <p> This is a quick recipe I just tried out for making homemade yogurt if you have an Instant Pot!</p>
        <p> First, let's start with the list of ingredients that you'll need to make this recipe</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Some milk (preferably whole, though lower fat percentages will work too</li>
            <li>A small amount of your favourite yogurt (this will be used as the starter)</li>
        </ul>
        <p> What you'll need to do is to thoroughy clean the inside of your Instant Pot, then add all of your milk.
            Now you'll simply select the "Yogurt" function on your cooker, and set it to <strong>Boil</strong>. 
            Once it's done, allow the milk to cool, then add a small amount of your starter yogurt.
            Mix it in well, then select the "Yogurt" function again on your Instant Pot, and set it to <strong>Low</strong> for 8 hours.
            After the 8 hours is up, you're done! Enjoy your yogurt plain, or with added fruit, sugar, anything that you like!
