        <p> This is a quick recipe I just tried out for making homemade yogurt if you have an Instant Pot!</p>
        <p> First, let's start with the list of ingredients that you'll need to make this recipe</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Some milk (preferably whole, though lower fat percentages will work too</li>
            <li>A small amount of your favourite yogurt (this will be used as the starter)</li>
        </ul>
        <p> Since the recipe is so simple, it's really just a few steps:
            <ol>
                <li>Thoroughly clean the inside of your Instant Pot</li>
                <li>Add all your milk to the pot, select the <strong>yogurt</strong> function, and set it to <strong>boil</strong></li>
                <li>Allow the milk to cool</li>
                <li>Add a small amount of your starter yogurt, and mix it in well</li>
                <li>Select the <strong>yogurt</strong> function again, but this time set it to <strong> low</strong> for 8 hours.</li>
            </ol>
            And that's all, after the 8 hours is up, you're done! Enjoy your yogurt plain,with added fruit, sugar, or anything that you like!
