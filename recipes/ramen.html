        <p>Ramen! You might be thinking, "How difficult could it be? Does it <em>really</em> need a recipe?"</p>
        <p>And you'd be right! There's really nothing simpler than some pre-packaged instant ramen, but if you want to give it just a bit of extra <em>something</em> then with just a little work it's easy to do.</p>
        <p>For this recipe, you'll need the following items:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Your favourite packaged instant ramen</li>
            <li>Some Eggs</li>
            <li>Red pepper powder, or red pepper paste (I usually get

                    this one
                </a>)</li>
            <li>Some Korean rice cakes (you can usually find these in the frozen section of your local asian or ethnic supermarket)</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            Great! Now it's time to make the ramen. Let's get started:
        </p>
        <ol>
            <li>Follow the instructions on your ramen package, and once you've added the seasoning and the noodles are becoming a bit soft:</li>
            <ul>
                <li>Add about a tablespoon of the red pepper powder or paste. If you find it's not flavourful enough, add some more!</li>
                <li>Crack two eggs into the pot</li>
            </ul>
            <li>Allow the ramen to cook until the noodles are soft and the eggs have firmed up to where they have gooey yolks and solid whites.</li>
            <li>Enjoy!</li>
        </ol>
        <p>I hope you enjoy this recipe, but it's quite loose, add whatever else you'd like and spice things up for next time! Experiment! There's no reason to keep having the same old plain ramen every time.</p>
